Part 8 Table: 

N  |  p  | #  Sims | Avg Result 
-------------------------------
10 | 0.5 | 100     |  3.480      
10 | 0.5 | 1000    |  3.462       
10 | 0.5 | 10000   |  3.536   
10 | 0.5 | 100000  |  3.521          
10 | 0.5 | 1000000 |  3.522  


The point of "diminishing returns" occurs after approximentaly 100000 
simulations have been done. This can easily be observed by examining the
results of the table above. While 100,000 simulations increases the accuracy
slightly, increasing the parameter to 1,000,000 yields a negligibile difference.

Summary

To ensure that the most amount of toilet paper remains when the first roll 
becomes empty, we should all be little-choosers.
